# FHE Extension Kit: A Toolkit for Building FHE-Powered Browser Extensions

The **FHE Extension Kit** is a developer toolkit designed for creating browser extensions that leverage **Zama's Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) technology**. By providing a streamlined approach to FHE encryption directly within the user's browser, this toolkit empowers developers to build applications that ensure privacy in online interactions, including secure payments and confidential identity proofs (DID). 

## Identifying the Pain Point

In the digital age, maintaining privacy while interacting with web applications has become a significant challenge. Users frequently share sensitive information online, yet existing browser extensions often lack robust privacy measures. As a result, users are susceptible to data breaches, identity theft, and various forms of tracking. This toolkit addresses these concerns head-on. 

## The FHE Solution

Through the implementation of Zama's state-of-the-art Fully Homomorphic Encryption, the FHE Extension Kit allows developers to write browser extensions that perform computations on encrypted data without needing access to the plaintext. This means that sensitive user data can be processed securely, ensuring that privacy remains intact while still enabling functionality. Utilizing Zama's open-source libraries such as **Concrete** and **TFHE-rs**, developers can easily integrate these powerful encryption methods into their browser applications, making it feasible to handle private data safely and efficiently.

## Key Features

- **Client-side FHE Encryption Library**: A comprehensive library that enables the seamless integration of FHE encryption into browser extensions.
- **Browser API Integration**: Easily connect with various browser APIs to enhance the functionality of your extensions.
- **Standardized Wallet Interaction Interface**: Developers can implement a uniform wallet communication protocol that streamlines transactions and user engagements.
- **Empowerment of Developers**: Create innovative Web3 applications that prioritize user privacy while harnessing advanced encryption methodologies.
- **Open-Source Contributions**: Access a wealth of example projects and collaborative opportunities to foster community development.

## Technology Stack

The **FHE Extension Kit** utilizes the following primary technologies:

- **Zama FHE SDK**: Core library for performing Fully Homomorphic Encryption operations.
- **Node.js**: Server-side JavaScript runtime that allows for efficient development of backend services.
- **Hardhat or Foundry**: Development environments for building smart contracts and managing deployment processes.
- **JavaScript/TypeScript**: Programming languages used in facilitating browser extension logic and interactions.

## Installation Guide

To get started with the **FHE Extension Kit**, follow these steps:

1. Download the project files to your local environmentâ€”**do not clone the repository**.
2. Ensure you have **Node.js** installed on your machine (version 14 or above is recommended).
3. Navigate to the project directory in your terminal.
4. Run the following command to install the necessary dependencies, including Zamaâ€™s FHE libraries:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

This command will fetch all required packages as specified in your `package.json`.

## Build & Run Guide

After setting up the project, you can compile and run the extension with the following commands:

1. To compile the smart contracts, use:

   ```bash
   npx hardhat compile
   ```

   This command will compile all Solidity files in your project.

2. To run the tests, execute:

   ```bash
   npx hardhat test
   ```

3. Finally, to start the development server and run your browser extension in a testing environment, use:

   ```bash
   npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js
   ```

   This script will deploy your smart contracts to the specified network.

### Example Code Snippet

Hereâ€™s a sample code snippet demonstrating the encryption of user data using the FHE library:

```javascript
import { FHE } from './fhem-library.js';

async function encryptUserData(userData) {
    const encryptedData = await FHE.encrypt(userData);
    console.log("Encrypted Data: ", encryptedData);
    return encryptedData;
}

// Sample usage
const sensitiveData = {
    creditCardNumber: "1234-5678-9012-3456",
    userDID: "did:example:123456789abcdefghi"
};

encryptUserData(sensitiveData);
```

This function takes sensitive user data as input and returns its FHE-encrypted version, ensuring maximum security throughout data processing.
